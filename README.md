# Rotary

![](https://github.com/joestanding/x86-os/actions/workflows/make.yml/badge.svg)

Rotary is my hobbyist operating system, currently for the x86 architecture. I'm developing it for fun and to further my knowledge of operating system internals, as there's no better way to learn something than to try and implement it yourself. It's named after the rotary engine, which is less efficient, less reliable and generally a worse choice than a piston engine.. but there's just something unique and cool about them.
